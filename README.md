# Odin Cafe #

A simple wepage for a fake restaurant that was an exercise from  [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page?ref=lnav)
that aimed to practice DOM manipulation through dynamic Javascript use. Furthermore, other technologies involved were npm and webpack.
Here are some screenshots.
